<summary><b>Database Migration</b></summary>

Migrations are Djangoâ€™s way of propagating changes we make to our models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into our database schema.

+ Make migrations:
  ```cmd
    python manage.py makemigrations
  ```
+ Migrate:
  ```cmd
    python manage.py migrate
  ```

Django framework have a build-in database named db.sqlite3. To manage our database we used DB SQLite3 Server. If it not availabe in our computer we need to download and install this.
