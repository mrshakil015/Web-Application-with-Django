+ Make migrations:
  ```cmd
    python manage.py makemigrations
  ```
+ Migrate:
  ```cmd
    python manage.py migrate
  ```

Django framework have a build-in database named db.sqlite3. To manage our database we used DB SQLite3 Server. If it not availabe in our computer we need to download and install this.

<summary><b>How to Display some text in web browser? Also add custom urls</b></summary>

To send content back to the client's web browser we can used `HttpResponse`. It is a class used to generate HTTP responses. It's part of Django's HTTP handling framework.

  ```python
  def homePage(request):
      return HttpResponse("Hello, Django!")
  ```
+ To display this content into web browser we need to connect this function into `urls.py` script. For do this open `urls.py` scripts.<br>
  Syntax:
  ```python
  from projectfoldername.scriptname import functionname
  ```
  Example:
  ```python
  from myProject.views import homePage
  ```
+ Also add this function with `urlpatterns = []` list:
  ```python
  path('routename',functionname , name="functionname"),
  ```
  Example:
  ```python
  path('home',homePage , name="homepage"),
  ```
+ After connect the url then run the project.
  ```python
  py manage.py runserver
  ```
